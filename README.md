<h1>Beautiful HUD ( bHUD )</h1>

<b>bHUD is a very nice HUD for Sandbox and PropHunt-Servers in Garry's Mod!</b>

<h2>It shows you:</h2>
- Own player data ( name, rank, team-color )
- Health
- Armor
- Weapon data ( name, ammo )
- current time ( day, month, year, hour, minute )
- played time ( hold c to expand the time panel )
- Minimap

<h2>Designs:</h2>

We are offering some nice designs for bHUD, so you are able to change between them whenever you want! (Just open the settings-menu to change between them)

<h3>Minimap:</h3>
We programed a completely new Minimap, as one Guy suggested in the comments!

- Very fast to render. It doesn't need much resources and anything from the server ( that means, that it doesn't matter if you have a high ping or not )
- You see the position, the name, the distance and the team color of every player on the server.
- You can change the size, position and scale of it in the settings ( If you want to know, how to open the settings, then just read through the whole text )

<h3>Custom Images:</h3>
- We have added some little custom images for the new bHUD
- Each of them are just 16 pixels big and therefore they only have about 500 bytes, so that shouldn't be a huge problem
- You don't need to install it client-side! A fully working copy of bHUD is enough! The rest will do bHUD for you.

<h3>Settings:</h3>
If you hold the <b>c-key</b>, you will see at the <b>right-bottom of the screen</b> a little <b>settings-icon</b>. Just <b>left-click</b> on it to open the settings.

- You can enable/disable bHUD or just some parts of it
- You can change some minimap, timeHUD and other HUD settings
- If you restart Garry's Mod, you will get the Settings back from your last configuration!

<h4>Server Restrictions:</h4>
You can also restrict some parts of bHUD <b>server-widely</b>. Just type into the server-console following commands:
- bhud_restrict hovername true/false (allow/restrict usability of hovernames)
- bhud_restrict minimap true/false (allow/restrict usability of the minimap)


<h3>Fixes:</h3>
We try to keep bHUD as bugfree as possible. Of course it could happen, that we created a new bug. It would be great, if you can post the error message of the server/client on the github/workshop page to let us know about it. We will fix it as soon as possible. Thanks!

Also we are open for all suggestions! So if you have a great idea for bHUD and you want to share it with us, then please post that too! We guarantee that we read through all of them!
