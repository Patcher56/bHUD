<h1>Beautiful HUD ( bHUD )</h1>

<b>bHUD is a very nice HUD for every kind of Garry's Mod Server.</b>

<h2>It shows you:</h2>
- Your Player Name
- Your Team
- Your Teamcolor
- Weapon Name
- Weapon Ammo ( Primary and Secondary )
- Current Time
- Played Time ( hold c ( or your key for the context-menu ) to expand the time panel )
- Minimap!

<h2>New Features:</h2>

We have completely redesigned bHUD. For some reason, we aren't able to change the first picture, so we will see the first version every time. From the second picture, you will see the new design of bHUD!

<h3>Minimap:</h3>
We have programed a completely new Minimap, as one Guy suggested in the comments!

- Very fast to render. It doesn't need much resources and it doesn't need anything from the server ( that means, that the performance of the minimap only depends on your own computer - it doesn't matter if you have a high ping or not )
- You see, where they are looking at the moment
- You see there name and the distance to them
- You see if they are above or below you ( for now we chosen "Meter" for the distance. It doesn't matter which name it has, because normally the length is called "Units" I think and it is a huge value. We divied it with 50 to get a better value. We would be able to call it "Apples" too ;) )
- You and all other players will have there own team-color
- You can change the size of it in the Settings-Panel ( If you want to know, how to open the settings-panel, just read through the whole text )

<h3>Custom Images:</h3>
- We have added some little custom images for the new bHUD
- Each of them are just 16 pixels big and therefore they only have about 500 bytes, so that shouldn't be a problem for downloading them ( You can find them here: "garrysmod/garrysmod/download/img/" )
- You don't need to install it client-side! You only need to install it on the server. The rest will do bHUD for you.

<h3>Settings:</h3>

<b>How to open the settings panel:</b>
Write in the chatbox: "!bhud_settings" and press enter!

- You can enable/disable every part of this HUD or the complete one
- You can change the size, position and border of the Minimap
- If you restart Garry's Mod, you will get the Settings back from your last configuration!

<h3>Fixes:</h3>
- You can now use bHUD in the SinglePlayer!
- You can now disable bHUD with the convar "cl_drawhud" without any issues
- You now see your Playername also in SinglePlayer-Mode
- Some other little issues

As you see, there are quite some changes and it is normal that there can be some new bugs. So we are kindly asking you, to post all bugs. Thanks!
Also we are open for all suggestions! So if you have a great idea for bHUD and you want to share it with all of us, then please also post it as a comment! We guarantee that we read all comments!
